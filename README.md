# Hi there, I'm Luis ðŸ‘‹

I'm an mechanical engineer transitioning to the data science industry. I'm passionate about leveraging data to create valuable insights and solve real-world problems for businesses.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I'm currently working on:

- [**Forecasting Food Retailer**](https://github.com/luis-cj/data-science-forecasting-food-retailer): developed a multi-step forecasting LightGBM model to predict sales of 10 food products in 2 different stores using recursive forecasting with a mean average error of 5 daily selling units.

- **End-to-End Machine Learning App**: created a weather forecasting app using my own Raspberry Pi and a microcontroller to predict the room temperature at home with an error of 5% using XGBoost.

- [**British Airways experience**](https://github.com/luis-cj/data-science-british-airways): identified top 5 reasons for customer dissatisfaction using NLP from actual reviews and built a classification tree-based ML model that helped identify the 5 most important factors when booking a flight.

- [**Retail market analysis**](https://github.com/luis-cj/data-science-retail-market-madrid): analysed Madrid neighborhoods using Airbnb data, identified 11 key areas for maximising renting revenue.

- [**Solar power plant generation analysis**](https://github.com/luis-cj/data-science-solar-power-plant): developed root cause analysis for equipment failures, resulting in the implementation of preventive measures that reduced future failures by 30%.
